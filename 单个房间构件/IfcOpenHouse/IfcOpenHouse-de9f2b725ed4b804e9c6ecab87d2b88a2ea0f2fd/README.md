# IfcOpenHouse

<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

More than 10 years ago, the original IfcOpenHouse 🏠 was created by
[Thomas Krijnen](https://github.com/aothms) by using the [IfcOpenShell
library](https://ifcopenshell.org/) 🐚. It consists of a single story
building with a gable roof, sitting on top of a NURBS surface ⛰️. It
includes a footing 🦶, walls 🧱🧱 with openings 🕳️ for doors 🚪 and
windows 🪟, a roof 🛖… but above all, it gives an overview about how to
programmatically build a simple IFC model from scratch 👩🏽‍💻.

Navigate through the following preview for yourself. Double click 🖱️ an
element to gather entity info from the underlying IFC:

<!-- This is where a canvas with an IFC.js visualisation of the model
    will be placed within the Quarto website -->
<div class="info-panel hidden" id="id-info-div">
    <p class="info" id="id-info-p"></p>
</div>
<div id="ifcjs-container">
</div>

The current repository is an exercise to recreate that same model, but
with the recent higher level [IfcOpenShell Python
API](https://blenderbim.org/docs-python/autoapi/index.html) 🐚🐍. This
same API is widely used today in the native IFC editing approach
followed by BIM authoring software like
[BlenderBIM](https://blenderbim.org/) and
[FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org/), among others. At the end, there’s
also a visualization cell with [IFC.js](https://ifcjs.github.io/info/),
the BIM toolkit 🛠️ for JavaScript.

It is a basic tutorial, but some basic IFC and Python knowledge is
required, as well as some basic trigonometry for the sizes and
coordinates 👩‍🎓. One of the goals is to show how powerful Jupyter 🪐
Notebooks 📒 can be 💪 as an experimentation playground. Note that this
notebook uses [nbdev
directives](https://nbdev.fast.ai/explanations/directives.html) to
automate the production of a script and a Quarto website, as well as
helping with [Git-friendly
Jupyter](https://nbdev.fast.ai/tutorials/git_friendly_jupyter.html).

## Getting started / local installation

These set of notebooks 📒 may be conveniently browsed through their
Quarto website 🌎, or alternatively be run on your own end by cloning
the repository. For the former, refer to the following section. For the
latter, follow these installation instructions 📝.

You’ll need
[Mambaforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge) 🐍
installed in case you don’t have it already. Then, you may run the
following commands to clone the repository and install all necessary
dependencies ✅.

``` sh
git clone https://github.com/cvillagrasa/IfcOpenHouse.git
mamba env create --file environment.yml
conda activate IfcOpenHouse
pip install -e .
```

Using the editable flag `-e`, you will be able to use any further
changes you make to the notebooks and/or Python modules immediately.

As an extra step, use dark mode 🕵️‍♂️ if you wish (see
[jupyter-themes](https://github.com/dunovank/jupyter-themes#user-content-command-line-examples)
for more info):

``` sh
jt -t chesterish -T -N -kl
```

You may now launch the Jupyter 🪐 Notebook 📒 dashboard:

``` bash
jupyter notebook
```

And that’s it! you are now ready to locally open the notebook
`nbs/00_generation.ipynb` and start having fun 🥳.

Lastly, you may also want to edit the JavaScript code 👩🏽‍💻 for the model
preview by running `npm i` from the `viz` directory, and regenerating
the bundle with `npm run build_nb`.

## Step-by-step tutorial / online

Alternatively, you may just start by browsing the contents firstly, and
perhaps attempt to run it locally later. Just go to
[generation](00_generation.ipynb) and you’ll find an IfcOpenHouse
generation online walkthrough 🚀🚀🚀.
